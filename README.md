# React Quiz App

This is my first self-made React app.
It is a quiz generating app that retrieves 10 questions from Open Trivia API based on the category and difficulty selected.
All categories are based on Nerdy topics such as Movies, Books and etc

## Tech used:

- React.js
- Tailwind.css
- Axios to replace fetch API
- API used was open trivia api: https://opentdb.com/

## Post mortem:

- Writing this app was pretty quick due to the knowledge I gained in part 2 of Full Stack Open's web development course
- Already I've noticed how tricky it is to pass data to React components, something they call 'drilling' I don't have a solution for this yet but I know there are solutions provided by the React ecosystem

### Some things I can improve:

- Learning about Promises
- Making use of axios better
- Could use some efficiency in handling the data
- Some bugs arise when special characters are used by the API
